# Terraforming-Sebastian-Lague-Remix

This project expects to be a implementation of the marching cubes algorithm for creating 3D digital terrains.
It is expected for the terrain to be broken down into multiple chunks that can be generated infinitely along the ground plane and rather infinitely or finitely on the horizontal axis.

As for the writing of this README, the software does meets these expectations.
